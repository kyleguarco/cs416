    </div>

    <div>

        <p>Open the peanut butter and jelly and remove any added seals in order to use the product.</p>

        <img alt="PB&J" src="https://cdn.instructables.com/ORIG/FXA/75RQ/IPE6KE33/FXA75RQIPE6KE33.jpg" />

        <p class="tip"><u><b>Tip:</b></u> Stir peanut butter if necessary to make a smoother mixture and distribute the
            oil that may
            have settled. Ours was fine so we skipped this step.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Step 5: Spread the Peanut Butter Onto One Slice of Bread</h2>

        <p>Get preferred amount of peanut butter onto the knife (for an accurate serving size, get about 2 tablespoons)
            and spread onto one slice of the bread evenly.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Step 6: Spread the Jelly Onto the Other Slice of Bread</h2>

        <p>Get preferred amount of jelly onto the knife (for an accurate serving size, get about 1 tablespoon) and
            spread onto one slice of the bread evenly.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Step 7: Combine the Two Slices</h2>

        <p>Combine the two slices together quickly. Try to match the two slices as close as possible so the crust is
            evenly matched on both sides so the sandwich is more appetizing and less messy.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Step 8: Cut Off the Crusts (optional)</h2>

        <p>Cut the crusts of the sandwich off using the butter knife. This step is optional for people who prefer no
            crusts.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Step 9: Cut Into Half</h2>

        <h2>Step 10: Clean Up Your Workspace</h2>

        <p>Clean up your workspace by closing the peanut butter and jelly, replacing the bread tie on the opening of the
            bread bag, washing your knife and disposing of your gloves.</p>

            is all up to you.</p>

            <p>I have to say, I'm amazed. I've had these ingredients just sitting around for months and until now I've
                never known a use for them! I made this sandwich a few days ago, but I am wondering what I should do
                about the blisters on my hands due to the gloves. There were no instruction to take them off afterwards
                so I’ve been spending my days wearing them, and it's becoming a little concerning. I am also still a
                little confused as to why my brother didn't enjoy the sandwich, as it was not an optional instruction,
                after telling him this he reminded me (rudely) that he has a peanut allergy. Is it true that this would
                stop him from enjoying it? Anyway, I've been in the hospital with him for a while now and I'm wondering
                if that instruction still applies? Should I show him the article? Do you think that would make a
                difference? I did bring the sandwich with me in case, thanks in advance! It also doesn't specify how the
                jelly should be applied, so I used my better judgment and used my hand. Overall, I'd love if you went
                into more detail next time, maybe a few hundred steps to be sure.</p>
